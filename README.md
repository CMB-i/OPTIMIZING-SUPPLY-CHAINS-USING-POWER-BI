# OPTIMIZING-SUPPLY-CHAINS-USING-POWER-BI
Data-driven decision making for efficient inventory, supplier, and manufacturing operations
By Charvi Bayana

**Project Overview**
This project presents an end-to-end supply chain performance analysis using Power BI. It demonstrates how data analytics can solve real-world supply chain challenges—such as high inventory costs, supplier delays, and inefficient logistics—by turning raw data into actionable insights.

The solution is an interactive, multi-layered dashboard that provides real-time visibility into key performance areas like manufacturing, inventory, suppliers, and customer trends.

**Objectives**
1. Understand how analytics can improve supply chain performance.
2. Track supply chain operations from supplier → manufacturing → inventory → customer.
3. Generate data-driven recommendations for operational efficiency.
4. Use Power BI for real-time visualization and custom dashboards.

**Tools & Technologies**
- Tool	Purpose
- Power BI	Data modeling and interactive dashboards
- Excel / CSV	Raw data cleaning and preparation
- Kaggle	Dataset sourcing
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)	Calculated fields (e.g., profit, growth, etc.)

**Methodology**
1. Data Collection
– Sourced supply chain datasets from Kaggle.
2. Data Cleaning
– Handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized date and category formats.
3. Data Modeling
– Structured data into logical groups: Inventory, Manufacturing, Suppliers, Customers.
4. Dashboard Development
– Built multiple visualizations in Power BI tailored to business needs.
5. Analysis & Insight Generation
– Identified key patterns, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities.

**Problem Statement**
Supply chains involve many stakeholders—manufacturers, suppliers, logistics, and customers. Without proper tracking, companies face:
🔁 High inventory costs due to poor stock visibility
🏭 Delays from supplier and manufacturing inefficiencies
🚚 Rising transportation expenses from suboptimal routing
🔍 Lack of real-time transparency across the chain

✅ **Solution:** Interactive Power BI Dashboard
The final deliverable is a comprehensive dashboard with:

**Section	Features**
Executive Summary	KPIs, trends, high-level insights
Manufacturing Analysis	Production volumes by time, bottlenecks
Supplier Analysis	Shipping costs, performance, lead times
Inventory Analysis	Stock levels by category, reorder points
Customer Insights	Product popularity by demographics

**Sample Insight**
- Most sales came from female customers → future products can target this demographic.
- Skincare was the top-selling product category.
- Delays were concentrated around Supplier B, suggesting need for renegotiation or replacement.

**Business Impact**
💸 Cost Reduction: Lower transportation and inventory overhead
🚚 Faster Delivery: Reduced lead times and better supplier alignment
✅ Fewer Stockouts: Optimized inventory levels
📈 Scalable: Dashboard can be extended to other departments or locations

**📌 Conclusion**
Using Power BI for supply chain analytics enables:
Real-time, data-driven decisions
Proactive issue resolution
Clear visibility across operations
Sustainable long-term planning

This project demonstrates how data visualization + analytics can directly improve supply chain efficiency, reduce cost, and boost customer satisfaction.
